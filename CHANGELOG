-------------------

- FIXED: Exception 'DoesNotExist:Image matching query does not exist' after ain 'Image Attach' save_note.
- FIXED: 'Attach Image' workflow now has proper state control (buttons).

- Replace Markdown with reStructuredText.

- GUI: Edit Note; change "Save and Close" button to icon and have all three 
  save and close permutations at top and bottom of note.
- CODING: Change 'Generic Views' back to regular/full Django views.
- FIXED: Page reload after going back to unlock encrypted note re-submits 
  encryption key (password).

1.0.1 (2018/04/05)
------------------

* FIXED: added missing initial migrations


1.0 (2018/03/30)
----------------

* FIXED: encrypted notes; unlock_note url without form data ('get' instead
  of 'post') should redirect to view_note instead of generating a 
  django error.
* POLICY CHANGE: The options DJAKEN_MARKDOWN_AUTO_ADD_LINE_BREAKS and 
  DJAKEN_MARKDOWN_AUTO_ADD_LINK_TAGS are now set to False by default. 
  This is due to the required text analysis can cause performance issues 
  with large inline attached images. To keep the same behaviour, the 
  option(s) will need to be set to True in the projects settings.py


1.0rc3 (2016/04/03)
-------------------

* FIXED: **CRITICAL BUG**; changing relevancy on encrypted notes causes note to be
  unable to unlock.
* FIXED: unwanted space under info / warning / error notifications.
* FIXED: more space needed above h1 elements (markdown title).
* FIXED: turn off client-side caching for notes pages (view_note and edit_note).
* FIXED: auto http link tagging should not apply to code blocks.
